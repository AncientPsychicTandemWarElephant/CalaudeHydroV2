# CLAUDE.md - Hydrophone Analyzer Development Strategy

This document outlines the development strategy for improving the Hydrophone Analyzer application. It serves as a living document to track tasks, decisions, and progress.

## Design Rules and Guidelines

### Core Development Principles

1. **Code Organization**
   - Edit existing modules rather than creating temporary/quick-fix modules
   - Only create new modules when required by architectural needs
   - Maintain clean directory structure by refactoring within existing files

2. **Incremental Development**
   - Make small, focused changes and test each change thoroughly
   - Avoid large-scale changes that could lead to untraceable issues
   - Document each change with its intended purpose and outcome

3. **Testing Methodology**
   - Develop test cases for each module to verify functionality
   - Implement automated tests where possible
   - Ensure each feature can be tested independently

4. **Logging and Verification**
   - Generate logs for all feature changes and tests
   - Verify feature operation through log analysis
   - Confirm functionality through user feedback

5. **Documentation**
   - Maintain DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md to track all testing and changes
   - Record when features were modified or tested
   - Create traceable history of development decisions

## Current Status Assessment

The Hydrophone Analyzer is currently a functional application with several technical challenges:

1. **UI Interaction Issues**:
   - Button handlers require special fixes via `direct_fix.py` and `state_buttons_fix.py`
   - Z-order problems with matplotlib components
   - Event handling reliability issues

2. **Navigation Instability**:
   - Time zoom functionality requiring special debug logging
   - Navigation controls needing additional fixes

3. **Error Management Challenges**:
   - Significant error logging infrastructure suggests recurring issues
   - Recovery mechanisms need enhancement

4. **RESOLVED: Export Data Integrity Issue (FIXED)**:
   - **Problem**: Multi-file exports created massive 8-hour timeline gaps in spectrogram visualization
   - **Root Cause Analysis**: Two-part timezone conversion bug in Export Tool
     - **Part 1**: Data timestamps were converted correctly (e.g., `02:29:13 UTC` → `10:29:13 Australia/Perth`)
     - **Part 2**: Header Start Time remained unconverted (still showing `02:29:13` with `Australia/Perth` timezone)
     - **Result**: Header claimed file started at `02:29:13 Australia/Perth` but data started at `10:29:13 Australia/Perth`
     - **Impact**: 8-hour inconsistency caused hydrophone viewer to interpret timeline as having massive gaps
   - **Deep Dive Investigation (May 2025)**:
     - Initial fix converted data timestamps but missed header Start Time conversion
     - Issue persisted due to two bugs in `export_processor.py`:
       1. `_create_ocean_sonics_header()` not converting Start Time when timezone changed
       2. `_regroup_sorted_data()` not preserving `original_timezone` field during chronological sorting
   - **Comprehensive Solution**:
     - **Export Tool Fixes**:
       - **Bug 1 Fix**: Enhanced `_create_ocean_sonics_header()` to detect timezone changes and convert Start Time
       - **Bug 2 Fix**: Added `_convert_start_time_timezone()` helper function for header timestamp conversion
       - **Bug 3 Fix**: Modified `_regroup_sorted_data()` to preserve `original_timezone` field during sorting
     - **Hydrophone Viewer Fix**:
       - **Bug 4 Fix**: Added detection for export-tool-processed files to prevent double timezone conversion
       - **Bug 5 Fix**: Modified timestamp handling to preserve already-converted timestamps
     - **Result**: Perfect header/data timestamp consistency in all export modes + eliminated viewer gaps
   - **Verification Results**:
     - **Before Fix**: Header `02:12:34 Australia/Perth`, Data `10:12:34` → **8.0 hour GAP**
     - **After Fix**: Header `10:12:34 Australia/Perth`, Data `10:12:34` → **CONSISTENT**
     - **Individual Exports**: ✅ All files show perfect header/data consistency
     - **Combined Exports**: ✅ Perfect header/data consistency maintained
     - **Timeline Continuity**: ✅ Natural 16.6-minute gaps between recordings (not 8-hour gaps)
   - **Status**: FULLY RESOLVED - Timeline gaps completely eliminated, continuous spectrogram visualization restored
   - **Test Data Locations**:
     - Original SABIC files: `/ClaudeHydro/probems/sabic fat/sabic fat/` (7 files: wavtS_20250423_*.txt)
     - Broken exported files: `/ClaudeHydro/probems/multi/` (7 files: wavtS_20250423_*_edited.txt)
     - Fixed test files: `/ClaudeHydro/probems/final_fix_validation/` (individual + combined exports)
     - Visual evidence: `/ClaudeHydro/probems/og multi.png` vs `/ClaudeHydro/probems/exported multi.png`
   - **Fix Implementation**:
     - **Export Tool**: `/ClaudeHydro/Export Tool/export_processor.py` (lines 566-573, 694-741, 467)
       - Added `_convert_start_time_timezone()` method for header timestamp conversion
       - Enhanced `_create_ocean_sonics_header()` with timezone conversion logic
       - Fixed `_regroup_sorted_data()` to preserve original timezone information
     - **Hydrophone Viewer**: `/ClaudeHydro/Hydrophone Claude Code/data_parser.py` (lines 44-54, 168-189)
       - Added export-tool-processed file detection ("File Details:" signature)
       - Modified timezone handling to prevent double conversion for processed files
       - Preserves timeline continuity for timezone-converted exports

   - Test UI element positioning and visibility
   - Validate user interaction workflows

2. **Navigation System Tests**
   - Test time zoom functionality with various data sizes
   - Verify navigation controls operate correctly
   - Ensure spectrogram updates appropriately with navigation changes

3. **Data Processing Tests**
   - Validate data loading from different file formats
   - Test data transformation and visualization pipelines
   - Verify correct handling of edge cases (empty files, malformed data)

4. **Visualization Tests**
   - Verify correct spectrogram rendering
   - Test FFT display functionality
   - Validate colormap and scaling functionality

### Test Documentation

All tests will be documented in DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md with:
- Date and time of testing
- Specific functionality tested
- Test inputs and expected outputs
- Actual results and observations
- Any issues discovered and their resolution

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Stability Focus (Current)
Focus on addressing the most critical stability issues:
1. Improve button handling within existing modules
2. Fix navigation and zoom functionality
3. Enhance error recovery mechanisms

### Phase 2: Architecture Improvement
Once stability is achieved, focus on architectural improvements:
1. Refactor and consolidate UI creation functions
2. Implement a cleaner event handling system
3. Reorganize code for better maintainability

### Phase 3: Feature Enhancement
After architectural improvements, focus on new features:
1. Add new visualization capabilities
2. Implement additional analysis tools
3. Enhance data import/export functionality

## Technical Debt Notes

- Button handling relies on axis position detection which is fragile
- Navigation system lacks proper error handling
- UI component creation is scattered across multiple functions
- Error logging is extensive but recovery mechanisms are limited
- State management is centralized but could benefit from better organization
- TextBox widgets experience lag due to matplotlib redrawing behavior

## Next Steps

1. Create DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md to track all testing and changes
2. Develop initial test cases for the button handling system
3. Begin incremental refactoring of the button handling approach within existing modules
4. Implement more comprehensive logging for the navigation system
