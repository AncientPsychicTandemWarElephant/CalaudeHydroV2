### 2025-05-15: Navigation System Bugfix

**Developer**: Claude & User  
**Type**: Bugfix  
**Module(s)**: event_handlers.py, state_buttons_fix.py  
**Description**:
- Fixed critical navigation bugs in the FFT display:
  1. Clicking on the right side of the navigation bar would expand the zoom window instead of panning
  2. Pan buttons would zoom out instead of panning when near data boundaries
- Improved the navigation system by:
  - Ensuring the zoom span is consistently maintained when panning
  - Fixing edge case handling when reaching data boundaries
  - Adding improved logging for navigation operations
  - Enhancing resize behavior for more predictable user interaction
- Made all navigation operations more consistent and predictable:
  - Click outside zoom: centers view on click point with fixed span
  - Drag: moves view with fixed span
  - Resize: allows adjusting zoom range with sensible limits
  - Pan buttons: maintain zoom span even at boundaries
  - Zoom in/out: preserves center point when possible

**Test Results**:
- Navigation now properly responds to clicks anywhere in the navigation bar
- Pan buttons work correctly at data boundaries
- Span is consistently maintained during all navigation operations
- Edge cases are properly handled when reaching data boundaries
- Detailed debug logging provides insight into navigation operations

**Issues**:
- The previous bugs caused confusion when trying to navigate to the right side of the dataset
- Root causes:
  1. In click handling: expanding view to include the click point instead of panning
  2. In pan buttons: not properly preserving the zoom span at data boundaries
  3. In zoom functions: inconsistent handling of edge cases

**Next Steps**:
1. Monitor usage to ensure navigation remains stable
2. Consider adding zoom level preset buttons for common zoom levels
3. Add visual indicators to show when navigation has reached a boundary

### 2025-05-15: Critical Navigation System Bug Fix

**Developer**: Claude & User  
**Type**: Critical Bugfix  
**Module(s)**: visualization.py, event_handlers.py  
**Description**:
- Fixed major navigation bug causing spectrograms to become completely misaligned when clicking near data boundaries
- Root cause identified: Using incorrect data dimensions and indexing for navigation bounds
- Implemented comprehensive fixes including:
  1. Fixed critical dimension error in update_time_zoom where it was using data.shape[1] instead of len(data)
  2. Corrected boundary handling to use data_length-1 as the maximum valid index
  3. Added proper conversion of mouse coordinates to integer data indices
  4. Implemented more robust validation and error checking
  5. Fixed zoom span preservation at data boundaries
  6. Added additional safeguards against data corruption during navigation
- Complete overhaul of navigation system with better error handling and logging

**Test Results**:
- Navigation now properly preserves zoom span when panning near boundaries
- Clicking in navigation bar properly centers the view on that point
- Edge case handling prevents out-of-bounds indexing
- No more distortion or misalignment in the spectrogram displays

**Issues**:
- Previous behavior caused spectrograms to be severely distorted when navigating near the right edge
- In extreme cases, using the navigation panning would completely misalign the spectrogram view 
- The issue could lead to negative time indices appearing on the axis
- Problem was most visible when repeatedly clicking near the right side of the navigation bar

**Next Steps**:
1. Add boundary indicators to show when navigation has reached data limits
2. Implement additional visual feedback when reaching data boundaries
3. Consider adding navigation presets for common zoom levels

### 2025-05-15: Export Dialog Bugfix

**Developer**: Claude & User  
**Type**: Bugfix  
**Module(s)**: event_handlers.py, export_dialog.py, data_export.py  
**Description**:
- Fixed multiple errors in the export functionality:
  1. "RuntimeError: Another Axes already grabs mouse input" - Fixed by releasing mouse grabs before showing the dialog
  2. "ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous." - Fixed by properly checking numpy arrays
  3. "NameError: name 'np' is not defined" - Fixed by adding missing numpy import to export_dialog.py
- Implemented comprehensive fixes:
  1. In on_export_data: Added code to release any mouse grabs before showing the dialog
  2. In show_export_dialog: Added robust error handling with a fallback export option
  3. In all export functions: Fixed numpy array truth value checking using proper patterns
- Added more thorough exception handling and logging during export operations

**Test Results**:
- Export button now works without triggering errors
- Added fallback export mechanism if the full dialog cannot be opened
- Better error reporting and recovery during export operations
- Fixed all instances of ambiguous numpy array truth value testing

**Issues**:
- First error was caused by matplotlib's internal event handling not properly releasing mouse grabs
- Second error was caused by using the pattern `if not array` with numpy arrays, which is ambiguous
- Arrays need explicit checking with `is None`, `len()`, and `isinstance()` to avoid ambiguity errors
- The fixes ensure proper cleanup and robust data validation throughout the export process

**Next Steps**:
1. Monitor export functionality to ensure it works consistently
2. Consider adding more export format options in the future
3. Add progress indicators for large exports
